<p>
1. Create Sample Tickets

- Create 3 sample tickets of varying priority through the end user interface that can be accessed through this URL "http://localhost/osTicket/"
- This will give us matters to address when using the "Admin Panel"

2. Address tickets as a Help Desk professional

- Log into the "Admin Panel" of the osTicket admin interface using this URL "http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php"
- The tickets created via the user interface should be visible.

3. Confirm Agent Access
   
- Verify that the "Agent" has access to the tickets that were created previosuly on the "Admin Panel"
- Setting Agent to "Supreme Admin" access should allow the agent "Jane Doe" to see all created tickets.
