1. Create Sample Tickets

- Create 3 sample tickets of varying priority through the end user interface that can be accessed through this URL. "http://localhost/osTicket/".
- This will give us matters to address when using the "Admin Panel".

3. Confirm Agent Access
   
- Verify that the "Agent" has access to the tickets that were created previosuly on the "Admin Panel".
- Setting Agent to "Supreme Admin" access should allow the agent "Jane Doe" to see all created tickets.
